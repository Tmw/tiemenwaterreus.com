I've always been fascinated by cutting edge technologies when it comes to web. And as you might have heard the new, hot and hip thing around is Webcomponents. I've been building web-apps with the guys of Awkward for almost two years now and I'm always looking to improve things. This is the very reason I became extremely interested in the whole Webcomponents-thing.

Ever since the beginning of the web we (as developers) were hacking around to mold the world wide web into a app-platform. But how can we possibly build interactive apps using something that is originally intended to be a text-document-sharing tool? That must be like bringing a dead fish to a gun-fight, right?

Us developers should be proud! We’ve came a long way. We actually can build fast, snappy, responsive web-applications that act and feel like native-applications. To do so we use various frameworks and libraries such as Backbone. But still we’re missing some features other platforms have like includes and encapsulations resulting in perfect reusability of code.

The days of hacking the WWW into a app-platform are almost over and Webcomponents are definitely a step in the right direction. But as with every awesome web feature we should wait at least a few **years** before we can actually put this in production. Or should we?

This is what my research will be all about. How can we put these awesome technologies into production? If you do a search for web components you will find a lot of articles explaining the basics, but how can we as a startup actually use these technologies while building a **product**.
