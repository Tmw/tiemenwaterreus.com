Hi! Let me take a few seconds to introduce myself. My name is Tiemen Waterreus and I live in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. I've been a student at Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences the past four years, but that is about to change. The only thing left to do is finish my graduation research.

This is the place where I will write about my research and post interesting stuff, discoveries and possibly some complaints.

## Awkward
Part of graduating is doing your research at a company of your choice. Finding a company wasn’t hard since I did my previous internship at [Awkward](http://www.madeawkward.com) and it was such a fun ride so I decided to join forces with the team for another half a year!

Awkward is a *little* startup based in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. We’re building digital products in collaboration with awesome clients and we work on our own projects. One of the products I worked on during my internship was [Shipment](http://www.shipmentapp.com) - a design sharing/collaboration tool. I’ve been working on multiple projects for them ever since. Mainly including iOS development, Ruby on Rails and Javascript using Backbone.

## Research
In a future post I will write in more detail about my research but in short it will be about Webcomponents and the furute of building rich web applications. I’ve started my research in Februari and expect to finish somewhere in June. In the meantime I would love for you guys to read along, send emails or collaborate in any other way!
